"""Solid-mechanics damage models.

One file per registered type; this package re-imports each so the
``@register_neml2_object`` side effects fire on package import.

Registered:

* Mazars CDM family: ``DamagedStress`` (Phase B), ``MazarsEquivalentStrain``
  (Phase D), ``MazarsDamageStressAlpha`` (Phase F). ``MazarsDamage`` with
  simplified α weighting (would have been Phase E) is intentionally not
  ported -- not used in our CDM workflow.
* Simo-Ju CDM family: ``WeibullDamage`` (three-parameter Brandyberry form).
